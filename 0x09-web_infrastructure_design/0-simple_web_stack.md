some specifics about this infrastructure:
1.What is a server
A server is a software or hardware device that accepts and responds to requests made over a network. 


2.What is the role of the domain name
A domain name is a unique string of text that's used to identify a specific resource on the internet. This could be anything from a website to an email or FTP server. When you access a website, its domain name is converted to a set of numbers (an IP address) to communicate with the website server to send requests for and receive website content.


3.what The type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com.
www.foobar.com uses an A record. This can be checked by running dig www.foobar.com.
Note: the results might be different but for the infrastructure in this design, an A record is used.
Address Mapping record (A Record)—also known as a DNS host record, stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv4 address.


4.What is the role of the web server
web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web
Web servers are used in web hosting, or the hosting of data for websites and web-based applications -- or web applications. 
5.The role of the application server.
To install, operate and host applications and associated services for end users, IT services and organizations and facilitates the hosting and delivery of high-end consumer or business applications

6.The role of the database.
To maintain a collection of organized information that can easily be accessed, managed and updated

7.What the server uses to communicate with the client (computer of the user requesting the website).
Communication between the client and the server occurs over the internet network through the TCP/IP protocol suite.


what the issues are with this infrastructure:

1. SPOF
A single point of failure (SPOF) is a part of a system that, if it fails, will stop the entire system from working
example:- in hardware can include power supply issues, network failures, and malfunctioning of the storage subsystem. On the other hand, software failures involve issues with the Directory Server or Proxy Server.


2. Downtime when maintenance needed(like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted).
When we need to run some maintenance checks on any component, they have to be put down or the server has to be turned off. Since there's only one server, the website would be experiencing a downtime.
Displaying a message on the URL – It is a fine technique to let the visitors know that the page is unavailable for a while and will be back after a few days, yet it fails to acknowledge the search engines as the developer hasn’t done the background coding.
Removing all files from the server – If the requested page is not found and error 404 is displayed, it gives an impression that the search engines cannot really find out what is happening.


3. Cannot scale if there's too much incoming traffic.
It would be hard to scale this infrastructure because one server contains the required components. The server can quickly run out of resources or slow down when it starts receiving a lot of requests.
